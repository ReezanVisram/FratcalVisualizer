# FratcalVisualizer
A C++ with OpenGL program that displays customizable and interactive fractals.

## Current Fractals List
1. The Mandelbrot Set (with interactive panning and zooming)
2. The Heighway Dragon Curve
3. Koch's Snowflake

## Future Fractals List
1. Sierpinski Triangle
2. Sierpinski Carpet
3. Fractal Tree
4. Cantor Set

I made this project to learn the basics of graphics programming (buffers, layouts, shaders), and to have a comprehensive set of simple fractals, which I find incredibly cool.

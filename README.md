# FratcalVisualizer
A C++ with OpenGL program that displays customizable and interactive fractals. I made this project to learn the basics of graphics programming (buffers, layouts, shaders), and to have a comprehensive set of two-dimensional fractals. 

## Current Fractals List
1. The Mandelbrot Set (with interactive panning and zooming)
2. The Heighway Dragon Curve
3. Koch's Snowflake
4. Sierpinski's Triangle

## Future Fractals List
1. Cantor Set
